	abstract = {A simple and easily implemented method for R-wave detection from ECG signals is presented. The method is based on the subtraction of a filtered version of the signal. The filter we use is a nonlinear median filter. The median filter is applied to the ECG signal. It results in a smoothed version of the signal, without any reminder of the R waves. This smoothed signal is then subtracted from the original signal and the resulting signal presents undistorted R-waves, without baseline drift. A simple threshold detection can then be performed on the filtered signal. Results are presented for simulated signals, with sinusoidal and step baseline drifts, as well as ECG complex shape change. The detection is accurate and the average error we obtained for 300s length signals was of the order of 10âˆ’8s, for RR intervals of 1s. Results are also presented for a real experimental signal with strong baseline drift, and the accuracy of the detection can be observed.},

abstract={The authors have designed a multirate digital signal processing algorithm to detect heartbeats in the electrocardiogram (ECG). The algorithm incorporates a filter bank (FB) which decomposes the ECG into subbands with uniform frequency bandwidths. The FB-based algorithm enables independent time and frequency analysis to be performed on a signal. Features computed from a set of the subbands and a heuristic detection strategy are used to fuse decisions from multiple one-channel beat detection algorithms. The overall beat detection algorithm has a sensitivity of 99.59\% and a positive predictivity of 99.56\% against the MIT/BIH database. Furthermore this is a real-time algorithm since its beat detection latency is minimal. The FB-based beat detection algorithm also inherently lends itself to a computationally efficient structure since the detection logic operates at the subband rate. The FB-based structure is potentially useful for performing multiple ECG processing tasks using one set of preprocessing filters.},

abstract={The QRS complex is the most striking waveform within the electrocardiogram (ECG). Since it reflects the electrical activity within the heart during the ventricular contraction, the time of its occurrence as well as its shape provide much information about the current state of the heart. Due to its characteristic shape it serves as the basis for the automated determination of the heart rate, as an entry point for classification schemes of the cardiac cycle, and often it is also used in ECG data compression algorithms. In that sense, QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Software QRS detection has been a research topic for more than 30 years. The evolution of these algorithms clearly reflects the great advances in computer technology. Within the last decade many new approaches to QRS detection have been proposed; for example, algorithms from the field of artificial neural networks genetic algorithms wavelet transforms, filter banks as well as heuristic methods mostly based on nonlinear transforms. The authors provide an overview of these recent developments as well as of formerly proposed algorithms.},

abstract={A well-known challenge during processor design is to obtain the best possible results for a typical target application domain that is generally described as a set of benchmarks. Obtaining the best possible result in turn becomes a complex tradeoff between the generality of the processor and the physical characteristics. A custom instruction to perform a task can result in significant improvements for an application, but generally, at the expense of some overhead for all other applications. In the recent years, Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors (ASIP) have gained popularity in production chips as well as in the research community. In this paper, we present a unique architecture and methodology to design ASIPs in the embedded controller domain by customizing an existing processor instruction set and architecture rather than creating an entirely new ASIP tuned to a benchmark},

abstract={A well-known challenge during processor design is to obtain best possible results for a typical target application domain by combining flexibility and computational performance. ASIPs (Application Specific Instruction Set Processors) provide a tradeoff between generality of processor (flexibility) and its physical characteristics (computational performance and silicon area). This paper evaluates an ASIP design methodology based on the extension of an existing instruction set and architecture described with LISA 2.0 language. The objective is to accelerate the ASIPs design process by using partially predefined, configurable RISC-like embedded processor cores that can be quickly tuned to given applications by means of ISE (Instruction Set Extension) techniques. A case study demonstrates the methodological approach for the JPEG algorithm and motion estimation encoding algorithm of H.264 encoding standard.},

abstract={ Current application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) design methodologies are mostly based on iterative architecture exploration that uses Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) and retargetable software development tools. However, for improved design efficiency, additional pre-architecture exploration tools are required to help narrow-down the huge design space and making coarse-grained instruction set architecture (ISA) decisions before detailed ADL modeling. Extensive application code profiling is the key in such early design stages. Based on a novel code instrumentation technology, we present a micro-profiling approach that fills the current gap between source-level and instruction-level profilers and combines their advantages w.r.t. speed and accuracy. We show how the micro-profiler is embedded into an advanced ASIP design flow and justify its use in a case study to design an MP3 decoder ASIP.},

The main advantage of ASIPs is the higher flexibility due to programmability compared to dedicated hardware. A drawback of this design style is an increase in power consumption. The current case study focuses on an ASIP design methodology considering the classical parameters computational performance and area as well as energy consumption simultaneously. Several ASIP power optimization options have been applied and evaluated: clock-gating, logic netlist restructuring, ISA optimization, instruction memory power reduction, and use of a dedicated coprocessor. These optimizations are demonstrated with the WORE (ISS-core) ASIP for DVB-T acquisition and tracking algorithms. The results reveal a potential of about one order of magnitude in energy savings for these optimizations },

@book{algdatboka,
	abstract = {Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student, the new second edition of \_Introduction to Algorithms\_ builds on the tradition of the original with a truly magisterial guide to the world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and yet approachable even for the maths- averse, this title sets a high standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for solving a wide range of computing problems. With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job at explaining each algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some maths background to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures, from basic linked list to trees (including binary trees, red-black and B-trees), this title really shines with clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit from this text in other ways. The book moves forward with more advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy algorithms, and amortised analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems (used in such real-world business problems as optimising flight schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along with sample solutions. This text closes with a grab bag of useful algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming, evaluating polynomials and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveloling salesmen problem, show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can still be used to generate useful, real-world answers. Throughout this text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome project), business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of related historical material often discussing original research in each area of algorithms. In all, they argue successfully that algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can be used to write better software that does more with better performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald Knuth's three-volume set, \_The Art of Computer Programming\_), this title sets a new standard for compiling the best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending the range and performance of real-world software. \_--Richard Dragan\_},

We have analyzed the most relevant contributions in this power budget and propose several ways to reduce them.

A companion paper (Paulin et al., 1997) presents a survey of application and architecture trends for embedded systems in these growth markets. However, the lack of suitable design technology remains a significant obstacle in the development of such systems. One of the key requirements is more efficient software compilation technology. Especially in the case of fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) cores, it is often cited that commercially available compilers are unable to take full advantage of the architectural features of the processor. Moreover, due to the shorter lifetimes and the architectural specialization of many processor cores, processor designers are often compelled to neglect the issue of compiler support. This situation has resulted in an increased research activity in the area of design tool support for embedded processors. This paper discusses design technology issues for embedded systems using processor cores, with a focus on software compilation tools. Architectural characteristics of contemporary processor cores are reviewed and tool requirements are formulated. This is followed by a comprehensive survey of both existing and new software compilation techniques that are considered important in the context of embedded processors},

This work defines the notion of instruction subsetting and explores its use as a means of reducing power consumption from the system level of design. Instruction subsetting is defined as creating an application specific instruction set processor from a more general processor such as a DSP. Although not as effective as an ASIC solution, instruction subsetting provides much of the power savings while maintaining some level of programmability. Instruction set choice strongly affects the savings. We synthesized 5 ASIPs through place and route and found that a poorly chosen instruction set may consume more than 4 times the energy of an ASIP with a proper instruction set choice. This finding will allow designers to consider another set of trade-offs in their hardware/software design space exploration},

abstract={Memory bandwidth is frequently a limiting factor in the design of high-speed switches and routers. We introduce a buffering scheme called ping-pong buffering, that increases memory bandwidth by a factor of two. Ping-pong buffering halves the number of memory operations per unit time, allowing faster buffers to be built from a given type of memory. Alternatively for a buffer of given bandwidth, ping-pong buffering allows the use of slower, lower-cost memory devices. But ping-pong buffers have an inherent penalty: they waste a fraction of the memory. Unless additional memory is used, the overflow rate is increased; in the worst case half of the memory is wasted. Although this can be compensated by doubling the size of the memory, this is undesirable in practice. Using simulations, we argue that the problem is eliminated by the addition of just 5% more memory. We show that this result holds over a wide range of traffic and switch types, for low or high offered load, and continues to hold when the buffer size is increased},

Data flow programs for signal processing are directed graphs where each node represents a function and each arc represents a signal path. Synchronous data flow (SDF) is a special case of data flow (either atomic or large grain) in which the number of data samples produced or consumed by each node on each invocation is specified a priori. Nodes can be scheduled statically (at compile time) onto single or parallel programmable processors so the run-time overhead usually associated with data flow evaporates. Multiple sample rates within the same system are easily and naturally handled. Conditions for correctness of SDF graph are explained and scheduling algorithms are described for homogeneous parallel processors sharing memory. A preliminary SDF software system for automatically generating assembly language code for DSP microcomputers is described. Two new efficiency techniques are introduced, static buffering and an extension to SDF to efficiently implement conditionals.},
