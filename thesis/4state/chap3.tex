\section{Limitations of glitch protection}
\label{sec:limits}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High logic cost 
    \item Slower execution of certain pipeline stages
    \item Lower throughput 
    \item A typical way of doing fault injection is though EMFI attacks which target larger components like caches or other memory components.
    How can we prevent these? Comparing the state of the entire chache is not viable, and thus we must allow a fault to persist in 
    memory untill it is read or used in one of the cores.

\end{itemize}
