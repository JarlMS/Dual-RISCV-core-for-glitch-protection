Glitch attacks can be divided into two main categories: invasive (e.g., decapsulating the chip\cite{intro_to_hw_hacking}) and non-invasive attacks (e.g., electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI), voltage- and clock-glitching). Often times software and firmware security measures can only protect against non-invasive glitches, as protecting from invasive glitches often require hardware modifications\cite{glitchresistor}. Due to the nature of invasive attacks, it is beyond the scope of this project to defend against them. These often aim at tampering with Read-Only Memory (ROM) or Boot-loaders on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), and are not effective against more complex systems like a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or a System on Chip (SoC). 

Non-invasive glitches can be performed as long as an attacker has access to a device. However, there is quite a lot of procedural vulnerability discovery that has to be done before an attack can be performed. In the case of EMFI the chip has to be repeatedly exposed to electromagnetic interference during execution, to then determine which areas are most vulnerable to attacks\cite{emfi_injection}. An example of this being performed on the BCM2837 SoC can be seen in 
Voltage- or clock-glitching can be performed as long as there is some way to access these signals externally. Both these methods require very precise timing by an attacker. This is why specialized tools such as the \textit{ChipWhisperer}\cite{chipWhisperer} are needed, as they allow extremely accurate fault-injection. However, these days it is also possible to perform effective glitch attacks with simple components in conjunction with a cheap Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\cite{hole_in_soc}.

Voltage-glitching is performed by momentarily dropping the supply voltage during execution of critical operations. Clock-glitching is performed by altering clock timing to violate setup and hold time requirements of the hardware\cite{intro_to_FI}. The results of glitching cannot always be predicted, however the mainly result in skipped or repeated CPU instructions, incorrect evaluation of CPU instructions or corrupt reads from memory devices\cite{intro_to_FI}. In general these faults can occur at any stage in the execution pipeline. 

Glitch attacks have over recent years become a more common and greater threat. Due to the nature of how these attacks are carried out, they are often a very affordable way to exploit hardware. Attackers have easy access to open source resources like the the 'ChipWhisperer Lite' which allows for easy access to hardware glitching tools as well as side channel analysis\cite{chipWhisperer}. In addition to this, FPGAs can be used to inject precisely timed faults as long as an attacker has access to the supply voltage or clock on a chip\cite{hole_in_soc}.

\section{Limitations of glitch protection}
\label{sec:limits}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High logic cost 
    \item Slower execution of certain pipeline stages
    \item Lower throughput 
    \item A typical way of doing fault injection is though EMFI attacks which target larger components like caches or other memory components.
    How can we prevent these? Comparing the state of the entire chache is not viable, and thus we must allow a fault to persist in 
    memory untill it is read or used in one of the cores.
