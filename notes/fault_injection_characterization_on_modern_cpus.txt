- Fault Injection Characterization on modern CPUs - From the ISA to the Micro-Architecture - 

The underlying fault effect is usually unknown on modern cpus because of their complexity

Practical fault attacks emerged in 2002 with an optical fault attack. 

Attacks aim at breaking the implemented algorithm and therefore focus on obtaining a precise fault. 

In 2015, 2016 several software countermeasures have een shown to be ineffective against certain class of fault attacks.

"Even if their specification is public, another issue with CPUs is that their imlementation is not available. Moreover,
most of the time, debug tools for these platforms are either only partially open or not available. Therefore the only way to
retrieve information is through the ISA layer."
