The following is encompassed in the Xsecure extension:
    > Security alerts 
    > Data independent timing 
    > Dummy instruction insertion 
    > Random instruction for hint 
    > Register file Error-Correcting Code (ECC)
    > Hardened Program Counter (PC)
    > Hardened Control and Status Registers (CSRs)
    > Interface integrity 
    > Bus protocol hardening 
    > Reduction of profiling infrastructure

* Security alerts

CV32E40S has two outputs for signaling security issues: A major and a minor alert. 
A major alert 'alert_major_o' indicates a critical security issue from which the core cannot recover. The minor alert 'alert_minor_o'
indicates potential security issues, which can b emonitored by a system over time. These outputs can be used by external hardware
to trigger security incident responses like for example a system wide reset or a memory erase. A security output is high for every 
clock cycle that the related security issue persists. 

The following results in a major security alert:
    > Register file ECC error
    > Hardened PC error 
    > Hardened CSR error
    > Non-associated instruction interface parity/checksum error
    > Non-associated data interface parity/checksum error
    > Instruction parity/checksum fault (i.e. when triggering a related exception)
    > Store parity/checksum fault (i.e. when triggering the related NMI)
    > Load parity/checksum fault NMI (i.e. when triggering the related NMI)
    > Bus protocol error

The following results in a minor security alert:
    > LFSR0, LFSR1, LFSR2 lockup
    > Instruction access fault 
    > Illegal instruction 
    > Load access fault 
    > Store/AMO access fault
    > Instruction bus fault 
    > Store bus fault NMI 
    > Load bus fault NMI
