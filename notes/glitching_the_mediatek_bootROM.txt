- There's A Hole In Your SoC: Glitching The MediaTek BootROM - 

This is a 64-bit ARM Cortex-A chip, so quite complex. Glitching of this SoC shows that the BootROM is 
suceptable to glitching, allowing an adversary to bypass signature verification of the preloader. 
This circumvents all secure boot functionality and enables the execution of unsigned preloader images, 
completely undermining the hardware root of trust.
