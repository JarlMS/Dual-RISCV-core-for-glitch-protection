- Initial plan for thesis - 

What are glitch attacks and how can they be performed? 
    * Power glitching 
    * Clock glitching 
    * Fault injection 

What is being done today to prevent glitch attacks?
    * cv32e40s
    * Hardened PC 
    * Hardened CSRs 
    * Xsecure extension 
    * More... 

What are the limitations of the ways glitch protection is done today? 
    * High logic cost 
    * Slower execution of certain pipeline stages 
    * Lower throughput 

Why might Dual Cores be a good way of doing glitch protection? 
    * Compare performance 
    * Compare area 
    * Compare timing 
    * Compare simulated power usage

Why is this solution good/bad/no significant change 

Things I need to test:
    * Check synthesized area and timing on both setups
    * Do fault injection in both setups 
        > Maybe write a module whose sole purpose is to randomly corrupt data
