- Physical Memory Protection - PMP - 

The PMP module is both statically and dynamically configurable. Static configuration is performed through top level parameters.
Dynamic configuration is performed through the Control and Status Registers (CSRs). 

The granularity of PMP address matching can be configured. The minimum granularity is 2^(PMP_GRANULARITY+2) bytes, so at least 4 bytes.

The number of PMP regions (PMP_NUM_REGIONS) can be configured. All PMP CSRs are always implemented, but CSRs (or bitfields of CSRs) relatedto PMP
entries with number (PMP_NUM_REGIONS) and above are hardwired to zero. 

The reset value of the PMP CSR registers can be set through the top level parameters. 

* Debug mode

In order for debug to always be possible, the PMP will disallow fetches, loads and stores in the Debug Module region when 
the hart is in debug mode, regardless of how the PMP is configured.
