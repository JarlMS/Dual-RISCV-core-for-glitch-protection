- Exceptions and Interrupts - 

The CV32E40S supports two interrupt architectures: CLIC and CLINT. They offer different tradeoffs, but if 
more than 19 interrupts are required, if programmable interrupt levels are required or if hardware 
support for preemption is important, then CLIC should be chosen. 

Exceptions in general cannot be disabled and are always active. All exceptions are precise. 

* Non Maskable Interrupts 

An NMI will occur when a load or store instruction experiences a bus fault. The fault resulting in an NMI is 
handled in an imprecise manner, meaning that the instruction that caused the fault is allowed to retire 
and the associated NMI is taken afterwards. 

* Interrupts 

Although the RISC-V-CLIC specification supports up to 4096 interrupts, the CV32E40S only supports at most 
1024.
