- Register File - 

cv32e40s has 31 32-bit wide registers which form registers 'x1' to 'x31'. Register 'x0' is statically bound to 0 and can only be
read, it does not contain any sequential logic. 

The register file has two read ports and one write port. Register file reads are performed in the 'ID' stage. 
Register file writed are perfoemd in the 'WB' stage.

* General Purpose Register File

The register file consists of positive-edge-triggered flip-flops. 

* Error Detection 

The register file has integrated error detection logic and a 6-bit hamming code for each word. This ensures detection of up to 
two errors in each register file word. Detecte derrors trigger a major alert. 

    * Hamming Code: Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. They are specifically designed to detect and 
    correct error in data. A notable feature of Hamming Codes is their ability to pinpoint errors in transmitted data bits. 
    * The Hamming Code acts as a form of checksum or signature of the original word. When data is written or read from the 
    register, the Hamming Code is updated or checked, respectively.
